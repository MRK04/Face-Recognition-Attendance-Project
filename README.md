# Face-Recognition-Attendance-Project

### [Abstract](https://pages.github.com/MRK04/Face-Recognition-Attendance-Project#Abstract):
----
  Face recognition is a biometric method of identifying an individual by comparing live capture with the stored record for that person. Face is the crucial part of the human body that uniquely identifies a person. Using the face characteristics as biometric, the face recognition system can be implemented. The most demanding task in any organization is attendance marking.
  Facial recognition-based attendance systems is the process of recognizing a student's face during attendance using facial biometrics based on high-resolution monitor video and other information technologies. This facial recognition project allows computer systems to quickly and accurately detect and recognize human faces in images captured by webcams / surveillance cameras. Faces are detected using the face recognition algorithm. The processed image is then compared to an existing record and its presence is marked accordingly in the database.
